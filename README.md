**Type:** Academic Project for the course of *Data Science Bootcamp*

**Group:** Francisco Costa, Jo√£o Gouveia, Pedro Riveira, Nuno Rocha

**Programming Languages and Technologies:** Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn), PowerBI

**Objective:** To understand the drivers behind employee attrition by developing a classifying model to predict whether an employee is in attrition or not (close to exit the company or not). Besides the model, the final output was a tool built in PowerBI (the PBIX file above).
